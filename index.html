                               <p>As a Counsellor and Psychotherapist I provide Confidential and Non-judgemental Emotional Support to individuals when they are feeling vulnerable and in need of support.  I work from a Person Centred and Humanistic perspective drawing on relevant disciplines and theories as required by each individual. I work in Sligo and Aspen in the midlands.</p>
                               <p> The following are a sample of the Therapeutic Interventions I use : </p>

                                    <p> Current research indicates that more than <em>one</em> in <em>four</em> adults experience difficulty in their lives at some point, recognising your needs and taking action is a sign of courage and strength. </p>
